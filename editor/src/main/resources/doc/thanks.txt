Thanks to:
 - Nintendo for making this awesome game.
 - Jathys for making the awesome SMILE.
 - My cousin that introduced me to Java, and together we have been through a lot of projects.
 - Metroid Construction community.
 - JetBrains for making IntelliJ, without it, we would still be stuck with Eclipse, and this project would never have been born.
 - Tango Desktop Project for making awesome icons.
