# jsm
Super Metroid editor

This project is not a good way to implement saving of data.
The way its done will most likely overwrite parts of itself.
The library does only decompress and not compress as i was not able to figure out the compression so the ported Compresch library shipping with jSM only works for uncompressing.
Feel free to use this project to learn and understand how parts of Super Metroid is put together.

This is a library to read out Super Metroid data from the ROM.

It only works with "Super Metroid (JU) (M2) [!]" rom.
